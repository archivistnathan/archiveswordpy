# archiveswordpy
Guess the archives word in this text-based Python game!

The game ramdomly selects an English archives word from a list derived the ICA Multilingual Archival Terminology (MAT).

## Rules
- The word is of random length. You have the length plus one attempts to guess the word.
- Each guess must be less than or equal to the lenght of the word.
- Letters in the correct location in the word are indicated by a green box, letters that are in an incorrect location by a yellow box, and letters not in the word by a grey box.

Have fun!
